# react-portfolio

This project is a portfolio of some of the work that I've done during the course of my coding bootcamp. It was built using React and deployed using GitHub Pages. Each thumbnail is a link to the deployed application and also has a link to the corresponding repository.
Each of the pages is conditionally rendered, the contact form has username,email and password validation and the resume page links to my latest resume on Google Docs.
My social links for GitHub,LinkedIn and Instagram are also included at the bottom of the page for your convenience.

Link to the deployed application: https://baloyd.github.io/react-portfolio/
